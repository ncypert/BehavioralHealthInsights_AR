Behavioral Health Resource Allocation and Outreach Strategies in Arkansas
Overview
This repository contains the SQL code, visualizations, and data analysis used to explore behavioral health resource allocation and outreach strategies in Arkansas. The project focuses on understanding utilization trends, socioeconomic factors, and population characteristics to inform actionable strategies for improving access to care.
Objectives
Analyze Behavioral Health Utilization: Identify counties and populations with the highest and lowest utilization rates. 
Analyze Population Demographis: Focus on the highest-utilizing groups, such as working aged individuals between the ages of 26-45. 
Collaborate with Policymakers: Develop strategies to enhance provider capabilities in rural communites and structure plans around the most underserved areas in the state. 
Improve Equity: Develop outreach measure to proactively engage the high-risk groups to decrease systemic barriers.
Contents
SQL code: Queries for data extraction, transformation, and analysis
Visualizations: Charts, graphs, and maps illustrating key findings

Findings
Key insights derived from the analysis include:
  -Behavioral health resources utilization is highest in counties such as White, Independence, Crawford, and Pope Counties. 
  - Limited internet access (<40%) includes Monroe, Howard, Scott, Phillips, Pike, Logan, Benton, and St. Francis counties
  - Higher poverty rates correlate with higher inpatient behavioral health utilization.

Implications
 - Allocate resources to meet demands in high utilization counties
 - Increase internet infrastructure to rural areas
 - Collaborate with policymakers to incentivize providers in underserved regions and leverage funding for infrastructure improvements
How to Use This Repository
